/**
 * You are conductor of a bus. You are given two arrays chairs[] and
 * passengers[] of equal length, where chairs[i] is the position of the ith
 * chair and passengers[j] is the position of the jth passenger. You may perform
 * the following move any number of times:
 * 
 * Increase or decrease the position of the ith passenger by 1 (i.e., moving the
 * ith passenger from position x to x+1 or x-1)
 * Return the minimum number of moves required to move each passenger to get a
 * chair.
 * Note: Although multiple chairs can occupy the same position, each passenger
 * must be assigned to exactly one unique chair.
 * 
 * Examples:
 * 
 * Input: chairs[] = [3, 1, 5], passengers[] = [2, 7, 4]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: The passengers are moved as follows:
 * - The first passenger is moved from position 2 to position 1 using 1 move.
 * - The second passenger is moved from position 7 to position 5 using 2 moves.
 * - The third passenger is moved from position 4 to position 3 using 1 move.
 * In total, 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 moves were used.
 * Input: chairs[] = [2, 2, 6, 6], passengers[] = [1, 3, 2, 6]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: Note that there are two chairs at position 2 and two chairs at
 * position 6.
 * The passangers are moved as follows:
 * - The first passenger is moved from position 1 to position 2 using 1 move.
 * - The second passenger is moved from position 3 to position 6 using 3 moves.
 * - The third passenger is not moved.
 * - The fourth passenger is not moved.
 * In total, 1 + 3 + 0 + 0 = 4 moves were used.
 * Constraints:
 * 1 ≤ n ≤ 105
 * 1 ≤ chairs[i], passengers[j] ≤ 104
 */

/**
 * Solution:
 * 1. Sort both the chairs and passengers arrays in ascending order.
 * 2. Initialize a variable moves to 0 to keep track of the total number of
 * moves required.
 * 3. Iterate through the sorted arrays and for each pair of chair and passenger,
 * calculate the absolute difference between their positions and add it to the
 * moves variable.
 * 4. Return the total number of moves required.
